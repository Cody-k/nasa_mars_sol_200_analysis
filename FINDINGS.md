## Mission Context

**Sol:** 200 (Mars day 200 of MSL mission)
**Earth Date:** 2013-058/059 (February 27-28, 2013)
**Location:** Gale Crater, Mars
**Instrument:** RAD (Radiation Assessment Detector)
**Mission Phase:** Early surface operations (first 200 sols)

## Detector Configuration

### Detector B (Low-Energy Particles)
**Thickness:** 300 μm (silicon detector)
**Mass:** 0.134208 g/cm²
**Purpose:** Measures low-energy charged particles and contributes to dose measurements

### Detector E (High-Energy Particles)
**Mass:** 34.818 mg/cm² (0.034818 g/cm²)
**Mass Ratio:** 0.26× relative to Detector B
**Purpose:** Measures high-energy particles and calculates radiation dose equivalent

**Design Note:** Detector E's lower mass (26% of Detector B) optimized for different particle energy ranges. Silicon detector array configuration typical for space radiation monitoring.

## Observations

**Count:** 44 RAD measurements recorded during Sol 200
**Observation Type:** Continuous radiation monitoring throughout Martian day
**Data Quality:** Complete detector parameter records, valid telemetry

**Temporal Coverage:** Multiple observations spanning Sol 200 operational period, providing radiation environment characterization at this mission phase.

## Scientific Significance

**Radiation Environment Characterization:**
Sol 200 represents early mission baseline measurements critical for understanding Mars surface radiation levels. RAD instrument provides essential data for:

1. **Human Mission Planning:** Surface radiation measurements inform crew exposure estimates for future crewed missions
2. **Instrument Validation:** Early-mission detector performance verification
3. **Environmental Baseline:** Gale Crater radiation environment during nominal solar activity
4. **Detector Calibration:** Mass and thickness parameters confirm instrument configuration

**Mission Timeline Context:**
- Sol 200 (~6.5 months into surface mission)
- Rover in Yellowknife Bay area of Gale Crater
- Early science phase, pre-Mount Sharp ascent
- Baseline radiation data for comparison with later mission phases

## Technical Notes

**Data Format:** NASA PDS EDR (Experimental Data Record)
**File Size:** 17MB text data with structured headers
**Detector Type:** Silicon solid-state detectors (B and E)
**Measurement Frequency:** Continuous monitoring with discrete observation records

**Limitations:**
- Position data shows zeros (rover position not included in this EDR file)
- Single sol snapshot (not longitudinal analysis)
- Detector dosimetry data present but not fully analyzed in current implementation

## Future Analysis Opportunities

**Potential Extensions:**
- Dosimetry analysis (total dose B/E values present in data file)
- LET (Linear Energy Transfer) spectrum analysis
- Comparison with other sols for temporal trends
- Cross-reference with solar activity data
- Mastcam image correlation (24 images available in dataset)

**Data Available But Not Analyzed:**
- Detailed counter data (particle event classifications)
- LET spectra (energy deposition patterns)
- Dosimetry totals (radiation dose measurements)
